## About

The development of security algorithms that fit in low-performance devices has led to the emergence of lightweight cryptography in the era of IoT devices. Prior to NIST's call to standardize an algorithm, pioneers in the field included Photon, Quark, and Spongent. A software implementation was created for each algorithm in C#. Subsequently, several tests were conducted on an IoT device, such as a Raspberry Pi.

The evaluation involves recording execution times after multiple iterations, comparing the code size of each algorithm, analyzing the number of lines of intermediate language, and evaluating memory usage at various key points. This paper presents the most significant aspects of my engineering thesis, which led to the creation of a theoretical testing framework for evaluating other algorithms.
