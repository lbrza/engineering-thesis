# Lightweight cryptography for Internet of Things devices

Computer Engineering (Bachelor's and master's degree), Universidad Argentina de la Empresa - UADE. December 2021.

## About

The thesis focuses on profiling lightweight cryptography. The pioneers in this field, such as the Photon, Quark, and Spongent algorithms, were developed prior to the NIST call for algorithm standardization. A software implementation was created for each algorithm in C#. Subsequently, several tests were conducted on an IoT device, such as a Raspberry Pi.

The evaluation involves recording execution times after multiple iterations, comparing the code size of each algorithm, analyzing the number of lines of intermediate language, and evaluating memory usage at various key points. 

The work was part of an official university research project that included other cryptographic subjects. The objective was to create a theoretical testing framework that can be reused in the future.
